## Challenges of Working with SMEs

1. **Availability:** SMEs' busy schedules may lead to delays and communication gaps.

2. **Communication:** SMEs' use of technical language may cause misunderstandings.

3. **Perspective:** SMEs may lack a broad understanding of IT constraints and challenges, leading to unrealistic expectations.

4. **Resistance to Change:** SMEs' resistance to new ideas may result in conflicts and slow progress.

5. **Knowledge Transfer:** Effectively transferring SMEs' knowledge to the IT team can be challenging.

Despite these challenges, the benefits of working with SMEs often outweigh the difficulties. Effective communication, mutual respect, and understanding can help mitigate these challenges.
